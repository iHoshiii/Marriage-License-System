  - Address management with Philippine location hierarchy
  - Family information (parents, guardians)
  - Citizenship and residency details
- **Dynamic Validation**: Age-based conditional fields and requirements
- **Address Integration**: Philippine address selection with province/municipality/barangay hierarchy

### 4. Excel Document Generation
- **Template-based Processing**: Pre-designed Excel templates for official forms
- **Dynamic Sheet Management**: Conditional sheet inclusion based on:
  - Applicant ages (consent/advice requirements)
  - Residency status (local vs. external applicants)
- **Data Mapping**: Automated population of form fields with proper formatting
- **Image Integration**: Real-time photo overlay and official seal placement
- **Multi-sheet Output**: Comprehensive application packages with notices, consents, and envelopes

### 5. Administrative Oversight
- **Employee Management**: Add/remove staff accounts and assign roles
- **Analytics Dashboard**: Track processing metrics, application volumes, and performance
- **System Monitoring**: Real-time status of office operations and system health
- **Report Generation**: Export data for compliance and planning purposes

```

### Key Technologies & Dependencies
- **Frontend**: Next.js, React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Node.js, Python, openpyxl, pandas, numpy
- **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL)
- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth
- **Address Data**: select-philippines-address library
- **Icons**: Lucide React
- **Animations**: Framer Motion

### Application Processing Workflow
1. **User Form Entry**: Applicants fill comprehensive marriage application form with dual applicant data
2. **Optional Document Upload**: Users can upload supporting documents (marriage counseling certificates, birth certificates, etc.)
3. **Data Review & Validation**: Users review all entered information and uploaded documents before submission
4. **Account Creation**: After form submission, users create accounts with role "user" for status tracking
5. **Dashboard Access**: Users access their dashboard showing application status (pending, approved, finished)
6. **Office Visit Instruction**: Dashboard displays instruction to visit the Municipal Office in Solano for processing
7. **Employee Code Processing**: Staff enters application code in employee dashboard to access and review application
8. **Employee Verification**: Staff reviews data, validates documents, makes necessary corrections, and captures applicant photos
9. **Document Finalization**: System assigns sequential document number and generates final Excel package
10. **File Download**: Employee downloads officially numbered document (e.g., "MARRIAGE_APPLICATION_2024_0001.xlsx")
11. **Status Updates**: Real-time status updates visible in user dashboard and employee/admin interfaces

### Excel Template Management
- **Template Location**: `necessary/data/APPLICATION-for-MARRIAGE-LICENSE.xlsx`
- **Dynamic Sheets**:
  - APPLICATION: Main application form
  - Notice: Official notices with image overlays
  - CONSENT sheets: Age-based consent requirements
  - ADVICE sheets: Counseling requirements
  - AddressBACKnotice: External applicant notices
  - EnvelopeAddress: Mailing information
- **Cell Mapping**: Hard-coded cell references for precise data placement
- **Formatting**: Uppercase conversion and proper data type handling

## Security Considerations
- **Two-Tier Access Control**: Public form filling with employee-controlled processing prevents unauthorized access
- **Form Locking Mechanism**: Submitted forms become read-only, preventing spam and data tampering
- **Unique Code System**: Alphanumeric application codes provide secure handoff between users and employees
- **Employee Authentication**: All processing operations require authenticated staff credentials
- **Input Validation**: Client and server-side validation with Philippine address verification
- **Process Isolation**: Python script execution in separate process space prevents system compromise
- **File Type Restrictions**: Strict Excel file generation with binary output validation
- **Session Management**: Secure token-based authentication with automatic timeouts
- **Audit Trail**: Complete logging of all form access, modifications, and processing actions

## Deployment & Development

- **Environment Configuration**: Supabase keys and environment variables
- **Build Process**: Next.js build system with TypeScript compilation
- **Python Dependencies**: pip-based package management for backend processing
- **Cross-platform**: Compatible with Windows, macOS, and Linux

## Future Enhancements
- Database integration for application tracking and historical data
- Offline capability for areas with poor internet connectivity
- Digital signature capabilities for electronic document approval
- Multi-language support for diverse applicant base
- Mobile camera integration for enhanced photo capture
- Image compression and storage optimization for Supabase free tier limits (target: <200KB per photo, ~800-1,600 applications capacity)
- Integration with LGU document management and archiving systems
- Advanced analytics and reporting for operational insights
- Audit logging and compliance reporting for regulatory requirements
- Queue management system for high-volume periods
- Integration with existing LGU databases and citizen registries

## System Requirements
